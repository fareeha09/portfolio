<title> PYTHON PROJECTS </title>

</head>
<br>Based on what we learned so far, there are many similarities between Python and Scratch.<br> Some are:<br>
 <ul>
   <li> define functions </li>
   <li> loops </li>
   <li> conditionals/ booleans </li>
   <li> variables/ parameters </li>
 </ul>
 <br>
About lists: Lists have indexes which represent the place values of each of the indexes in a list. You represent it by [].<br> For example, x= [1,2,3,4]  <br> The first index is x[0] which is 1.<br>
 <br> In order to complete the project I worked with Rose. We finished pretty quickly and it was pretty great to see our results. <br>
 We then went on to try it with different colors. <br>
