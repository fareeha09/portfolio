<br>Based on what we learned so far, there are many similarities between Python and Scratch.<br> Some are:<br>
 <ul>
   <li> define functions </li>
   <li> loops </li>
   <li> conditionals/ booleans </li>
   <li> variables/ parameters </li>
 </ul>

 7/21/17- <strong> Reflection on Making a Filter project </strong><br>
About lists: Lists have indexes which represent the place values of each of the indexes in a list. You represent it by [].<br> For example, x= [1,2,3,4]  <br> The first index is x[0] which is 1.<br>
 <br> In order to complete the project I worked with Rose. We finished pretty quickly and it was pretty great to see our results. <br>
 We then went on to try it with different colors. <br>
 The difficulties of this Obamicon project was trying to figure out how to format the code. We had the basic idea but because tupuls are immutable,<br>
 we had to think of another way.
 Each element of core4 was used because we had variables that were used in each function. We used the 'for' loop to get each element in the list of pixels.<br> We also used if then statements which required booleans.
 If I could make another filter, I would make a filter similar to snapchat's one.
 I really enjoyed it when we were able to make a filter that was almost like the filters on our phone. It took a lot of trial and error and we almost gave up, <br>
 but at the last second we managed to make it work and that was a relief.
